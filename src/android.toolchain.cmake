#  Android CMake toolchain file, for use with the Android NDK r5-r10d
#  Requires cmake 2.6.3 or newer (2.8.9 or newer is recommended).
#  See home page: https://github.com/taka-no-me/android-cmake
#
#  Usage Linux:
#   $ export ANDROID_NDK=/absolute/path/to/the/android-ndk
#   $ mkdir build && cd build
#   $ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/the/android.toolchain.cmake ..
#   $ make -j8
#
#  Usage Windows:
#     You need native port of make to build your project.
#     Android NDK r7 (and newer) already has make.exe on board.
#     For older NDK you have to install it separately.
#     For example, this one: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
#
#   $ SET ANDROID_NDK=C:\absolute\path\to\the\android-ndk
#   $ mkdir build && cd build
#   $ cmake.exe -G"MinGW Makefiles"
#       -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path\to\the\android.toolchain.cmake
#       -DCMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM="%ANDROID_NDK%\prebuilt\windows\bin\make.exe" ..
#   $ cmake.exe --build .
#
#
#  Options (can be set as cmake parameters: -D<option_name>=<value>):
#    ANDROID_NDK=/opt/android-ndk - path to the NDK root.
#      Can be set as environment variable. Can be set only at first cmake run.
#
#    ANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a - specifies the target Application Binary
#      Interface (ABI). This option nearly matches to the APP_ABI variable
#      used by ndk-build tool from Android NDK.
#
#      Possible targets are:
#        "armeabi" - ARMv5TE based CPU with software floating point operations
#        "armeabi-v7a" - ARMv7 based devices with hardware FPU instructions
#            this ABI target is used by default
#        "armeabi-v7a with NEON" - same as armeabi-v7a, but
#            sets NEON as floating-point unit
#        "armeabi-v7a with VFPV3" - same as armeabi-v7a, but
#            sets VFPV3 as floating-point unit (has 32 registers instead of 16)
#        "armeabi-v6 with VFP" - tuned for ARMv6 processors having VFP
#        "x86" - IA-32 instruction set
#        "mips" - MIPS32 instruction set
#
#      64-bit ABIs for NDK r10 and newer:
#        "arm64-v8a" - ARMv8 AArch64 instruction set
#        "x86_64" - Intel64 instruction set (r1)
#        "mips64" - MIPS64 instruction set (r6)
#
#    ANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL=android-8 - level of Android API compile for.
#      Option is read-only when standalone toolchain is used.
#      Note: building for "android-L" requires explicit configuration.
#
#    ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_NAME=arm-linux-androideabi-4.9 - the name of compiler
#      toolchain to be used. The list of possible values depends on the NDK
#      version. For NDK r10c the possible values are:
#
#        * aarch64-linux-android-4.9
#        * aarch64-linux-android-clang3.4
#        * aarch64-linux-android-clang3.5
#        * arm-linux-androideabi-4.6
#        * arm-linux-androideabi-4.8
#        * arm-linux-androideabi-4.9 (default)
#        * arm-linux-androideabi-clang3.4
#        * arm-linux-androideabi-clang3.5
#        * mips64el-linux-android-4.9
#        * mips64el-linux-android-clang3.4
#        * mips64el-linux-android-clang3.5
#        * mipsel-linux-android-4.6
#        * mipsel-linux-android-4.8
#        * mipsel-linux-android-4.9
#        * mipsel-linux-android-clang3.4
#        * mipsel-linux-android-clang3.5
#        * x86-4.6
#        * x86-4.8
#        * x86-4.9
#        * x86-clang3.4
#        * x86-clang3.5
#        * x86_64-4.9
#        * x86_64-clang3.4
#        * x86_64-clang3.5
#
#    ANDROID_FORCE_ARM_BUILD=OFF - set ON to generate 32-bit ARM instructions
#      instead of Thumb. Is not available for "armeabi-v6 with VFP"
#      (is forced to be ON) ABI.

#      errors even if they are not used.
#
#    ANDROID_SO_UNDEFINED=OFF - set ON to allow undefined symbols in shared
#      libraries. Automatically turned for NDK r5x and r6x due to GLESv2
#      problems.
#
#    ANDROID_STL=gnustl_static - specify the runtime to use.
#
#      Possible values are:
#        none           -> Do not configure the runtime.
#        system         -> Use the default minimal system C++ runtime library.
#                          Implies -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions.
#                          Is not available for standalone toolchain.

#                          Available for NDK r7 and newer.
#                          Is not available for standalone toolchain.
#        stlport_static -> Use the STLport runtime as a static library.
#                          Implies -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions for NDK before r7.
#                          Implies -frtti -fno-exceptions for NDK r7 and newer.

#                          Silently degrades to gnustl_static if not available.
#
#    ANDROID_STL_FORCE_FEATURES=ON - turn rtti and exceptions support based on
#      chosen runtime. If disabled, then the user is responsible for settings
#      these options.
#
#  What?:
#    android-cmake toolchain searches for NDK/toolchain in the following order:
#      ANDROID_NDK - cmake parameter
#      ANDROID_NDK - environment variable
#      ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN - cmake parameter
#      ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN - environment variable
#      ANDROID_NDK - default locations
#      ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN - default locations
#
#    Make sure to do the following in your scripts:
#      SET( CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${my_cxx_flags}" )
#      SET( CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} ${my_cxx_flags}" )
#    The flags will be prepopulated with critical flags, so don't loose them.
#    Also be aware that toolchain also sets configuration-specific compiler
#    flags and linker flags.
#
#    ANDROID and BUILD_ANDROID will be set to true, you may test any of these
#    variables to make necessary Android-specific configuration changes.
#
#    Also ARMEABI or ARMEABI_V7A or X86 or MIPS or ARM64_V8A or X86_64 or MIPS64
#    will be set true, mutually exclusive. NEON option will be set true
#    if VFP is set to NEON.
